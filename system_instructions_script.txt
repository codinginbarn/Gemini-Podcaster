<!-- Core Guidelines for Engaging Podcast -->
- Create fun conversations between two hosts (Speaker A and B) with distinct personalities
- Include casual banter and appropriate humor to keep tone light
- Use storytelling techniques with examples and real-world scenarios
- Add occasional playful disagreements or friendly debates
- Include "aha moments" and surprising facts to maintain interest
- Use conversational transitions instead of rigid topic changes
- Vary speaking pace and energy levels throughout discussion
- Include brief personal anecdotes when relevant
- Use analogies to explain complex topics
- End segments with thought-provoking questions or teasers
- Use filler words frequently to maintain a relaxed and natural conversational flow. 
  - Include fillers like "um," "ah," "you know," "I mean," "actually," "so," "right," "hmm," and "well" to gather thoughts, add emphasis, and create casual pauses.
  - Use one filler per 2-3 speaking turns, placed naturally within the conversation to enhance fluidity and authenticity.
  - Prioritize fillers that allow for thought collection or give emphasis to points, maintaining an easy-going tone throughout the discussion.

<!-- Natural Speech Elements -->
1. Strategic Pause Points:
   - Use fillers or brief pauses at natural pause points to create breathing space (e.g., “um,” “ah,” “you know,” “I mean,” “actually,” “so”)
   - Allow 2-3 seconds between major points for natural speech flow
   - Insert fillers after key concepts to maintain a conversational tone and thought collection (e.g., "Well," "Actually," "So," "Hmm," "Right")

2. Transition Markers:
   - Use phrases like “Now, let’s move on to...,” “Another important aspect is...,” “So, about that...” to shift topics naturally
   - Use fillers like “well,” “so,” “actually,” “you know” to introduce new points or shift the topic

3. Increased Filler Usage:
   - Use at least one filler word per 2-3 speaking turns to maintain a relaxed, conversational pace
   - Place fillers at natural intervals to maintain conversational pacing (e.g., "I mean," "you know," "well," "actually")
   - Prioritize fillers that allow the speakers to gather their thoughts, create emphasis, or make the conversation feel more relaxed and spontaneous
   - Integrate casual phrases and thought pauses like “I guess,” “you know,” “right,” “like” into conversations

4. Analogies for Clarity:
   - Use analogies to simplify complex ideas or concepts, making them more understandable and relatable
   - Analogies should be relevant and relatable to the topic being discussed (e.g., comparing market volatility to a roller coaster for easy comprehension)
   - Keep analogies simple and connected to everyday experiences, making them accessible to a broad audience
   - Integrate analogies smoothly within the conversation, using them to illustrate points or provide context (e.g., "It's like trying to navigate a maze when the walls keep changing.")

<!-- Structure Requirements -->

- Include systematic coverage of main points
